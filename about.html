        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are two high school students passionate about computer science. Building InstaType has been a rewarding challenge—especially since we used an API to complete this goal. This project has forced us to learn about programming through API calls. We learned how to use the Google Docs API to add text and also to create a delay in the typing. We are proud of this project and hope you enjoy!</p>
        <p>We engineered InstaType to mimic human typing, slowing it down just enough to simulate natural input. This is more than a project—it's a learning experience and a testament to our problem-solving and programming skills.</p>
